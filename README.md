Technical Test for Redtix



Technical Test

Create a basic user CRUD page using Datatables, this test would take roughly 2 - 3 hours:

Things needed in the test
1.	Create a git repo (you can use either bitbucket, gitlab or github) and deploy before starting, commit everything for each development process
2.	User table migration
3.	Datatable page with basic filterings (filter by email / status / name)
4.	Create user page - basic validation is needed (all fields are required / valid email checking)
5.	Edit user page

User table schema:
●	id
●	email
●	first_name
●	last_name
●	status (active / inactive)

Note:
●	A simple UI framework like bootstrap would do, you do not need to use any fancy UIs for this test
●	No authentication module is needed
